The RFM12 and RFM69 wireless radio modules by [Hope
RF](http://www.hoperf.com/rf%5Ftransceiver/) are small low-power RF units with
an SPI interface, which can easily be mounted on a PCB alongside a µC.

### RFM12B

This is the radio module that
[started](https://jeelabs.org/2008/12/10/wireless-rfm12b-module/) the JeeNode
family (and JeeLabs):

Unlike simpler "ASK" (Amplitude Shift Keying) and "OOK" (On-Off Keying) radios,
these modules use "FSK" (Frequency Shift Keying) to generate well-defined
packets with a _preamble_, a _header_, a _payload_, and a _checksum_ at much
higher data rates, so that messages can be sent within milliseconds, with
support for multiple nodes on the same frequency band and with packet error
detection through the checksum.

In the **RF12** driver (note the _absence_ of an "M") in [JeeLib](../jeelib),
the radio data rate is ≈ 50 Kbaud, which translates to one byte
sent or received every 160 µs. Since there is no buffering in the RFM12B,
the driver has to use interrupts to sustain such data rates.

### RFM69CW

This is the RFM69CW, the successor of the RFM12B. The "C" stands for compatible,
meaning that the physical footprint is similar, although there are some subtle
differences in the way interrupts signals work:

The RFM69 modules have an on-board 66-byte FIFO buffer, allowing them to send
and collect packets without µC intervention. This considerably simplifies the
**RF69** driver logic and timing requirements. These radios can also use
built-in 128-bit AES _hardware_ encryption, but note that this requires all
nodes in the network to work in encrypted mode and share the same key.

There are variants of the RF69 driver which use the same "compat" packet format
as the original RF12 driver, making it possible to add new modules to existing
sensor networks. Conversely, there is also a modified RF12 driver
which makes it compatible with the new "native" RF69 format - this allows
re-using older RFM12B-based nodes in a network of new RF69-oriented sensor
nodes, and is probably the better long-term option.
