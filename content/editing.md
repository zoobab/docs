The contents of this site is generated from the
[jeelabs/docs](https://github.com/jeelabs/docs) repository on GitHub.

#### If you have commit access

The "Edit this page" link in the top left opens GitHub's online editor.
Changes made this way will automatically update the site via a webhook, which is
very convenient for fixing typos, small changes, etc.

#### If you don't have commit access

The "Edit this page" link in the top left will lead to a page where you can
"fork" the `docs` repository and edit your copy. To get your changes incorporated
into this site, please create a "pull request".

If you expect to make more changes, you can also add a [new
issue](https://github.com/jeelabs/docs/issues) on GitHub with your plans and
be added as contributor by one of the admins for direct edit/commit
access.

#### More substantial changes

For larger changes, it's much more convenient to use Hugo's "live preview"
server mode, which instally shows the effect of every
change as soon as you changes are saved to file.
